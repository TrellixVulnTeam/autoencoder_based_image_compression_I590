NOTE ON THE LIBRARY THAT CONTAINS TENSORFLOW UTILITIES

The quantization bin widths are used in the functions:
    (i) `add_noise`
    (ii) `approximate_entropy`
To ensure that the quantization bin widths are strictly
positive every time they are used, one assertion is required
in each of the two functions.

The method `__init__` of class `EntropyAutoencoder` calls
the function `approximate_entropy` and the function
`loss_density_approximation`. If these two functions called
the function `approximate_probability`, the Tensorflow
operators in the function `approximate_probability` would
be added two times to the graph when calling `__init__`. To
avoid this, `approximate_entropy` and `loss_density_approximation`
do not call `approximate_probability` and the output of
`approximate_probability` is passed as argument of `approximate_entropy`
and `loss_density_approximation`.
