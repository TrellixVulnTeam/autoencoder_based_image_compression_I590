NOTE ON THE ENTROPY AUTOENCODER

(i) When `NB_MAPS_1` is equal to 128, `NB_MAPS_2` is equal to
128, `NB_MAPS_3` is equal to 128, `KERNEL_WIDTH_1` is equal to
9, `KERNEL_WIDTH_2` is equal to 5 and `KERNEL_WIDTH_3` is equal
to 5, the number of parameters of the entropy autoencoder
(convolutional kernels, biases, additive coefficients of GDNs/IGDNS
and weights of GDNs/IGDNs) is 1758848. This calculation does not
include either the parameters of the piecewise linear functions
or the quantization bin widths.

(ii) Crucial detail! For the convolutional kernels in the
3rd encoder layer and the convolutional kernels in the 1st
decoder layer, the standard deviation of the normal distribution
at initialization is equal to 0.05. The entropy autoencoder is
sensitive to the initialization!
