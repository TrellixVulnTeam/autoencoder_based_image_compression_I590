NOTE ON THE LIBRARY THAT CONTAINS COMMON TOOLS

The quantization bin widths are used in the functions:
    (i) `average_entropies`
    (ii) `count_symbols`
    (iii) `discrete_entropy`
    (v) `quantize_per_map`
    (vi) `rate_3d`
The function `quantize_per_map` is directly called by the function
`average_entropies`.
The function `count_symbols` is directly called by the function
`discrete_entropy`.
The function `discrete_entropy` is directly called by the
functions `average_entropies` and `rate_3d`.
To ensure that the quantization bin widths are strictly
positive every time they are used, one check is required
in the function `quantize_per_map` and another one
is required in the function `count_symbols`.
