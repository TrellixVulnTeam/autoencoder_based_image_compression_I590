NOTE ON THE LIBRARY THAT CONTAINS COMMON TOOLS

The function `index_linear_piece` is directly called by the functions:
    (i) `approximate_probability`
    (ii) `gradient_entropy`
    (iii) `gradient_density_approximation`
The function `approximate_probability` is directly called by the functions:
    (i) `differential_entropy`
    (ii) `loss_density_approximation`
The function `differential_entropy` is directly called by the function
`approximate_entropy`.
The function `approximate_entropy` is directly called by the function
`loss_entropy_reconstruction`.
The two assertions in the function `index_linear_piece`
ensures that there is no latent variable perturbed by
uniform noise out of the grid bounds every time one of
the above functions is called.

The quantization bin width is used in the functions:
    (i) `approximate_entropy`
    (ii) `count_symbols`
    (iii) `discrete_entropy`
    (iv) `loss_entropy_reconstruction`
    (v) `quantization`
The function `approximate_entropy` is directly called by the function
`loss_entropy_reconstruction`.
The function `quantization` is directly called by the function
`count_symbols`.
The function `count_symbols` is directly called by the function
`discrete_entropy`.
To ensure that the quantization bin width is strictly
positive every time it is used, one assertion is required
in the function `approximate_entropy` and another one
is required in the function `quantization`.
