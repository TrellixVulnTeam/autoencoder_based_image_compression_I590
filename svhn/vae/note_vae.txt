NOTE ON THE VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODER

(i) In the objective function, there are two distinct terms:
the opposite of the variational lower bound and the l2-norm
weight decay. In the opposite of the variational lower bound,
there are two distinct terms: the scaled Kullback-Lieber
divergence of the approximate posterior from the prior and
the error between the visible units and their reconstruction.

(ii) When the number of recognition hidden units is 300 and
the number of latent variables is 25, the number of parameters
of the variational autoencoder is 1869422.
