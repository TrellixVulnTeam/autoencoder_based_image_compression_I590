NOTE ON THE ENTROPY AUTOENCODER

(i) In the objective function to be minimized
over the entropy autoencoder parameters, there
are two distinct terms: the entropy-reconstruction
loss and the l2-norm weight decay. In the
entropy-reconstruction loss, there are two distinct
terms: the scaled approximate entropy of the quantized
latent variables and the error between the visible units
and their reconstruction.

(ii) When the number of encoder hidden units is 300
and the number of latent variables is 200, the number
of parameters of the entropy autoencoder (weights and
biases) is 1967072. This calculation does not include
either the parameters of the piecewise linear function
or the quantization bin width.

(iii) Crucial detail! For the weights connecting the
encoder hidden units to the latent variables and the
weights connecting the latent variables perturbed by
uniform noise to the decoder hidden units, the standard
deviation of the normal distribution at initialization
is 0.05.
